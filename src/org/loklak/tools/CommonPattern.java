/**
 * This class provides Pattern constants to be used to replace a regex in
 * s.split(regex) method calls. Because s.split(regex) causes an execution of
 * Pattern.compile(regex).split(s, 0), it is wise to pre-compile all regex to a
 * pattern p. Therefore do the following: transform your code into Pattern p =
 * Pattern.compile(regex); p.split(s); The compilation of a specific pattern
 * should be done only once. Therefore this class provides Pattern objects for
 * the most common regex Strings.
 * 
 * The same applies to s.replaceall(regex, replacement) which is equal to
 * Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(s).replaceAll(replacement);
