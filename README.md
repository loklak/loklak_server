# loklak
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/loklak/loklak_server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/loklak/loklak_server)

loklak is a server application which is able to collect messages from various sources, including twitter. The server contains a search index and a peer-to-peer index sharing interface. All messages are stored in a elasticsearch index.

'Lok Lak' is also a very tasty Cambodian stir-fry meat dish (usually beef) with a LOT of fresh black pepper. If you ever have the chance to eat Beef Lok Lak, please try it. I hope not to scare vegetarians with this name, currently I am one as well.


## Why should I use loklak?

If you like to be anonymous when searching things, want to archive tweets or messages about specific topics and if you are looking for a tool to create statistics about tweet topics, then you may consider loklak. With loklak you can do:

- collect and store a very, very large amount of tweets
- create your own search engine for tweets
- omit authentication enforcement for API requests on twitter
- share tweets and tweet archives with other loklak users
- search anonymously on your own search portal
- create your own tweet search portal or statistical evaluations
- use Kibana to analyze large amounts of tweets for statistical data.

## How do I install loklak: Download, Build, Run

At this time, loklak is not provided in compiled form, you easily build it yourself. It's not difficult and done in one minute! The source code is hosted at https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server, you can download it and run loklak with:

    > git clone https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server.git
    > cd loklak_server
    > ant
    > bin/start.sh

After all server processes are running, loklak tries to open a browser page itself. If that does not happen, just open http://localhost:9000; if you made the installation on a headless or remote server, then replace 'localhost' with your server name.

To stop loklak, run: (this will block until the server has actually terminated)

    > bin/stop.sh

A self-upgrading process is available which must be triggered by a shell command. Just run:

    > bin/upgrade.sh
